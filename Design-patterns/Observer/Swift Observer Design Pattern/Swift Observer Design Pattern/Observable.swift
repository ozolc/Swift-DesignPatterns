import UIKit

// Make notification names consistent and avoid stringly-typing.
// Try to use constants instead of strings or numbers.

extension Notification.Name {
    static let networkConnection = Notification.Name("networkConnection")
    static let batteryStatus = Notification.Name("batteryStatus")
    static let locationChange = Notification.Name("locationChange")

// Various network connection states -- made consistent.

// This protocol forms the basic design for OBSERVERS,
// entities whose operation CRTICIALLY depends
// on the status of some other, usually single, entity.
// Adopters of this protocol SUBSCRIBE to and RECEIVE
// notifications about that critical entity/resource.

    func handleNotification()

// This template class abstracts out all the details
// necessary for an entity to SUBSCRIBE to and RECEIVE
// notifications about a critical entity/resource.
// It provides a "hook" (handleNotification()) in which
// subclasses of this base class can pretty much do whatever
// they need to do when specific notifications are received.
// This is basically an "abstract" class, not detectable
// at compile time, but I felt this was an exceptional case.

class Observer: ObserverProtocol {
    // This specific state reported by "notificationOfInterest."
    // I use String for maximum portability. Yeah, yeah...
    // stringly-typed...
    var statusValue: String
    
    // The key to the notification's "userInfo" dictionary, with
    // which we can read the specific state and store in "statusValue."
    // I use String for maximum portability. Yeah, yeah...
    // stringly-typed...
    let statusKey: String
    
    // The name of the notification this class has registered
    // to receive whenever messages are broadcast.
    let notificationOfInterest: Notification.Name
    
    // Initializer which registers/subscribes/listens for a specific
    // notification and then watches for a specific state as reported
    // by notifications when received.

        self.statusValue = "N/A"
        self.statusKey = statusKey.rawValue

        subscribe()
    }
    
    // We're registering self (this) with NotificationCenter to receive
    // all notifications with the name stored in "notificationOfInterest."
    // Whenever one of those notifications is received, the
    // "receiveNotification(_:)" method is called.
    func subscribe() {
        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(receiveNotification(_:)), name: notificationOfInterest, object: nil)
    }
    
    // It's a good idea to un-register from notifications when we no
    // longer need to listen, but this is more of a historic curiosity
    // as, since iOS 9.0, the OS does some type of cleanup.
    func unsubscribe() {
        NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(self, name: notificationOfInterest, object: nil)
    }
    
    // Called whenever a message labelled "notificationOfInterest"
    // is received. This is our chance to do something when the
    // state of that critical resource we're observing changes.
    // This method "must have one and only one argument (an instance
    // of NSNotification)."

    // YOU MUST OVERRIDE THIS METHOD; YOU MUST SUBCLASS THIS CLASS.
    // I've MacGyvered this class into being "abstract" so you
    // can subclass and specialize as much as you want and not
    // have to worry about NotificationCenter details.

// (many?) that are all listening for notifications
// from some usually single critical resource. Notice that
// it's brief and can serve as a model for creating
// handlers for all sorts of notifications.
